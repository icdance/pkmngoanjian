- Information :
This is another simple script for pogo game, which is based on a app that can simulate Tap/Touch behavior by finding pixel color. it is using the same app as my last script post (Auto-Farm, Catch, Inventory Managing Script -- Configurable), but eaiser to set up.

NOTE: This is NOT a bot, or a 3rd party app that cause you banned, and it won't dodge attacks or snipe pokemon at a gym. It is just an app that help you tap the screen, more like a saver for your finger/mouse.
